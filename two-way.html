    <h2>Two-Way Processing</h2>
    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Communication is not one-way. It requires both a sender and a receiver with feedback to confirm the message is understood.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In class, a teacher asks “Do you understand?” and we nod collectively. That nod is feedback, we never spoke verbally but the message has been received and acknowledged.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without feedback, we don’t know if we’ve been understood. That’s how misunderstandings happen, especially in emails or texts where verbal and physical feedback is often undetected.</p>
