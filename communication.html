    <h2>What is Communication?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Communication is the process of creating and sharing meaning through verbal and nonverbal messages.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> You say “I’m fine” while clearly upset. The words say one thing, the tone says another. Communication includes more than just words.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Miscommunication leads to conflicts, frustration, and missed opportunities. Effective communication builds connection and clarity.</p>
