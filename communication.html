    <h2>What is Communication?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Communication is creating and sharing meaning through verbal and or nonverbal messages.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You say “I’m fine” while clearly upset. The words say one thing, the tone says another. That's communication, it includes more than just words.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Miscommunication can lead to conflictions, frustration, and missed opportunities. Effective communication builds a deeper connection and clarity.</p>
