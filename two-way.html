    <h2>Two-Way Processing</h2>
    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Communication is not one-way. It requires both a sender and a receiver — with feedback to confirm the message is understood.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In class, a teacher asks “Do you understand?” and a student nods. That nod is feedback — the message has been received and acknowledged.</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without feedback, we don’t know if we’ve been understood. That’s how misunderstandings happen — especially in emails or texts.</p>
